# RL-workshop-101

A collection of hands-on labs for learning the basics of Reinforcement Learning (RL). This repository contains three practical examples that cover different aspects of RL, from basic environments to advanced techniques.

## Labs Overview

### 1. Simple Lunar Lander (01-simple-lunar-lander)
A completed example demonstrating basic RL concepts using the Lunar Lander environment from Gymnasium. This lab covers:
- Setting up a basic RL environment
- Training an agent using Stable-Baselines3
- Evaluating and visualizing the trained agent
- Understanding basic RL concepts like rewards, states, and actions

### 2. Multi-Agent Soccer (03-multi-agent-soccer)
An example of multi-agent reinforcement learning using a simplified soccer environment. This lab covers:
- Working with multi-agent environments
- Training multiple agents to cooperate
- Implementing communication between agents
- Evaluating multi-agent performance

### 3. GRPO for Generative AI (02-grpo-genai)
A practical example of using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for fine-tuning language models. This lab covers:
- Setting up a language model for fine-tuning
- Implementing GRPO training loop
- Fine-tuning a model on custom tasks
- Evaluating the model's performance
